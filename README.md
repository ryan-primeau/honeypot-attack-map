<h1>Azure Home SOC â€“ Cloud-Based Honeypot & Sentinel Integration</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
Implemented a foundational Security Operations Center (SOC) in Microsoft Azure using a free subscription. This project involves:

  - Deploying a virtual machine as an internet-facing honeypot.
  - Configuring a Log Analytics Workspace to centralize and forward logs.
  - Integrating Microsoft Sentinel to query failed login attempts, locate attack sources, and build a dynamic attack map.
    
This hands-on project demonstrates practical cloud cybersecurity operations, log analysis, and threat detection, making it an ideal learning tool for both beginners and seasoned professionals.
